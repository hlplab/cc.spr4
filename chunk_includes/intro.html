In order to participate in this experiment, you need to be a native speaker of American English (i.e. you must have moved to the U.S. before the age of 6 and you must have lived there most of your life). Thank you for participating in this study.</p>

<p>
You will read short 1-4 sentence snippets which were extracted and transcribed from dialogues on various topics, such as politics, family life, movies, etc. Sometimes these snippets contain text from only one speaker (S1), other times there are short pieces of dialogues where both speaker S1 and speaker S2 contributed. Since the sentences are drawn from natural conversations, some of them may be fragments or they may contain transcribed disfluencies, as in "And, he was like, uh, from Portland.".</p>

<p>Sentences will be presented word-by-word. You will advance through sentences by pressing the SPACE bar. Each sentence will be displayed on a separate line.</p>

<p>We are interested in how fast these sentences can be read while you still understand them. That's why about half of the snippets will be followed by at least one, sometimes two, content questions about them.</p> 

<p>
Try to answer those questions as fast as possible but also as accurately as possible given the content of the most recently displayed dialogue snippet. You can answer "yes" by pressing 1 and answer "no" by pressing 2 (you will be reminded of that every time you see a question). For example, you might read:</p>
<pre>
    S1: And he bought himself a new car by some, by some American car company.
    S2: Uh, really?
</pre>

<p>And you might be asked:</p>
<pre>
    Are cars always expensive?
</pre>
<p>The correct answer here would be 'No' since this information is not given in the dialogue snippet.</p>

<p>
Before the real experiment starts you will go through four practice trials.</p>

<p>
At the end of the experiment you will be given a code to paste into the HIT on Mechanical Turk to verify that you completed the experiment.</p>

<p>
Feedback about the experiment is always welcome. Thank you for helping us understand the cognitive processes involved in reading.
